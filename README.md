# harmonics-constructor

A small python script written with the goal to understand more about musical harmonics and python.  

Has a little basic functionality if called on command line like so: 

```bash
python3 main.py
```  

You can choose from a base note of the chromatic scale (considering both the sharp and the flat notes).

So either from  

```
C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B
```

 or

 ```
 C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb, B
 ```

Then choose a mode (tonality) for the scale:

```
major - maj, minor - min, pentatonic - pent

```

 and the chord:

```
major - maj, minor - min, dominant 7 - dom7, 
major 7 - maj7, minor 7 - min7
```
